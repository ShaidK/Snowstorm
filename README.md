the following command (_Replace the "X.X.X" with the current [Release Version][4]_):

```

Build, Lint & Package the Project.

To launch the "Snowstorm Project" you will need to press the "F5" Key within
[Visual Studio Code][1]. This will open an [Extension Host][9] which will allow
you to analyse & debug the "Snowstorm Project" locally.

**NPM SCRIPTS**

The "Snowstorm Project" consist of some "[npm][8]" scripts which are configured
within the "[package.json][10]" file. These are mainly configured to Build, Lint
& Package the "Snowstorm Project".

You can run these scripts by running the "[tasks.json][6]" file which will build
the Project _(See [Task][11] for more information)_ or by running the following
command:
